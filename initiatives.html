  <h1><center>Steps Taken by Government to Protect Wildlife and Its Habitats</center></h3>
  <text style="font-size: 20px;"><br>
    The Government of India has implemented numerous measures to safeguard wildlife and their habitats, preventing any recent extinctions. These efforts encompass initiatives such as protected area creation, wildlife conservation programs, anti-poaching measures, habitat restoration, and public awareness campaigns, all aimed at ensuring the conservation of India's diverse fauna. Following are the steps taken by the government to conserve the fauna:
   <br><br><br>
    <b>Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972: </b>

The act aims to protect and conserve forests by requiring prior approval from the central government for any diversion of forest land for activities like mining, industry, infrastructure development, and agriculture. It ensures that the ecological and environmental value of forests is considered before any such diversion takes place. The act provides guidelines for compensatory afforestation, which is the practice of replanting or rehabilitating degraded forest land to offset the loss of forest cover. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 serves as a crucial tool for the sustainable management and conservation of India's forest resources.

    <b>National Parks: </b>
    National parks in India are protected areas that are designated and managed by the government for the conservation of India's diverse ecosystems, wildlife, and cultural heritage. These parks serve as vital habitats for a wide range of species and play a significant role in preserving the country's biodiversity.
    <br><br>
    National parks in India are characterized by their unique landscapes, including forests, grasslands, wetlands, mountains, and coastal areas. They are established to maintain the ecological balance and integrity of these natural environments, protecting native flora and fauna and conserving their habitats.
    <br><br>
    The primary objective of national parks in India is the preservation of natural resources and the promotion of sustainable practices. These parks have legal safeguards in place to ensure their protection, and activities that may harm the environment or disturb wildlife are restricted.
    <br><br>
    In addition to their conservation significance, national parks in India also offer opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and nature-based tourism. Visitors can engage in activities like wildlife spotting, birdwatching, hiking, and camping, while adhering to guidelines that prioritize the well-being of the ecosystems and wildlife.
    <br><br>
    In total there are 106 existing national parks in India covering an area of 44,378 km square (17,134 sq million), which is 1.35% of the geographical area of the country (National Wildlife Database, Dec. 2020).

    <b>Wildlife Sanctuary: </b>
    Wildlife sanctuaries are protected areas designated by governments to provide a safe haven for wildlife and their habitats. These areas are specifically set aside for the conservation and protection of wildlife species, allowing them to thrive in a relatively undisturbed environment. Wildlife sanctuaries are established to safeguard biodiversity, preserve ecological balance, and provide spaces for scientific research, education, and eco-tourism.
    <br><br>
    In wildlife sanctuaries, human activities that may harm or disturb wildlife are strictly regulated or prohibited. These areas serve as important refuges for endangered or threatened species, allowing them to breed, feed, and migrate without significant human interference. Wildlife sanctuaries often encompass diverse ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and coastal areas, providing habitats for a wide range of flora and fauna.
    <br><br>  
    In India, wildlife sanctuaries are governed by the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The country has numerous wildlife sanctuaries, each with its own unique characteristics and resident species. Some well-known wildlife sanctuaries in India include Ranthambore Wildlife Sanctuary, Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandipur National Park, and Kanha National Park. These sanctuaries play a vital role in preserving India's rich biodiversity and promoting the conservation of wildlife.

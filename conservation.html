  <b>So what exactly is conservation?</b>
  <br><br><br>
  The word "conservation" of course comes from "to conserve" — to preserve, protect, save, defend, support, maintain, sustain: the opposite of "destroy" (or letting something be destroyed).
<br><br>
We often say we want to "preserve wildlands" or "conserve water." When it comes to the environment — well, we want to preserve/conserve the whole thing.
<br><br>
That means, as conservationists, we're taking action to save the ecosystems around us (like oceans, forests and deserts), the species that live in them (from birds to bears to bugs), and our planet's climate (which shapes the weather patterns, and the life-support systems, that keep us all going).
<br><br>
We don't always have instant success when we try to protect a wild place or endangered species. But often, we actually do — and that feel amazing. The Center for Biological Diversity actually wins its legal cases for endangered species about 93 percent of the time ... which, trust us, is a lot!
<br><br>
The point is that even if we don't succeed in one step toward saving a species or its habitat, the goal of conservation is to keep trying, to save as much as we possibly can for as long as we can. Meanwhile, we learn from our losses and celebrate our big and small victories — and we feel good about what we're doing throughout it all.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>So what are we saving our environment from?</b>
<br><br><br>
Most often conservationists are trying to protect our natural world from the effects that we ourselves — humans — are having on that world. That is, conservation often means humans saving nature from humans. Weird, right?
<br><br>
People don't usually hurt the Earth on purpose, of course — at least not just for the sake of hurting it. Some people in big business do know they're harming our environment when their companies abuse our natural resources in the quest for money. But most people don't mean any harm — it's just that we can't really help but change our environment, to some degree, just by living on this planet. And over the past couple of hundred years, since the beginning of the widespread use of fossil fuels, those changes have accelerated in a way that's dangerous not only to nature, but to our own societies.
<br><br>
All of us live in buildings that were at some time constructed on top of wildlands, where animals and plants once lived and grew without humans bothering them. All of us have possessions made from resources taken from our environment, like the wood taken from trees in a forest to make a pencil. And when we light up our houses at night, most of us use electricity that comes from a power plant burning a fossil fuel — like coal. When we ride in cars, buses or planes, we also burn fossil fuels — oil and gasoline. Burning these fuels pollutes the air and creates climate change.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Why should I care about the environment?</b>
<br><br><br>
Caring about the environment is crucial because it directly affects our survival, quality of life, and the well-being of future generations. A healthy environment provides clean air, fresh water, and nutritious food, which are fundamental for our physical and mental health. Furthermore, by conserving ecosystems and biodiversity, we ensure the stability of natural processes that sustain life, regulate climate, and provide essential resources. Environmental degradation, such as pollution and habitat destruction, not only harms ecosystems and species but also poses risks to human health, exacerbates climate change, and threatens our overall quality of life. By caring for the environment, we protect our own well-being and contribute to the sustainability and resilience of our planet.

<br><br><br><br>
<b>Why should I be excited about it?</b>
<br><br><br>
The answer is: Nature is exciting. And so is being a part of the battle to defend it — which you're doing right now, just by learning.
<br><br>
If you live near a park, a patch of woods or another wild place, go there and pay attention to all the living things. If you live in a big city, observe the urban wildlife, like pigeons and ants, and see if you can get your family on a day hike or camping trip.
<br><br>
Whatever you do, if it has to do with animals and the rest of nature, keep your mind wide open and we're pretty sure you won't be bored.

<br><br><br><br>
<b>Now I am really excited to conserve animals. Please tell me some methods to do so.</b>

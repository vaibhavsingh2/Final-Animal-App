  <text style="font-size: 20px;">As Vaibhav, a 12th-grade student in 2023-24, I am immensely proud of the app that my friends Nitya, Manya, and I have created. This journey of developing our app has been an incredible learning experience for all of us. However, I must admit that without the constant motivation and invaluable help from our teacher, Mrs. Vineeta Robert Simon, this app would not have come to fruition. Our teacher's unwavering support and belief in our abilities have been the driving force behind our success. Her encouragement and dedication has fueled our passion and pushed us to overcome obstacles, allowing us to transform our vision into a reality.
